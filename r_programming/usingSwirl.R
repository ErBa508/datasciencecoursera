# If you've used swirl in the past, you will need to type the following from the R prompt:
# install_from_swirl("R Programming")

# | You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are already at
# | the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message
# | letting you know you've done so.
# 
# | When you are at the R prompt (>):
# | -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
# | -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
# | -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
# | -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
# | -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
# | -- Typing info() displays these options again.
